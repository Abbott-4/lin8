  <h1> EDUCATION</h1><br>
<p> Studying computer application technology in Ningbo City Vocational and Technical College.</p><br>
  <p>Elective courses are: English writing, English listening, English reading and so on.</p><br>
  <p>Learned PS, AE,MYSQL, Maya and other software use.</p><br><br>
 <h1> INTERESTS AND HOBBIES</h1><br>
  <p>I have many hobbies.</P><br>
  <P> First of all, I like playing badminton and tennis. Sometimes I invite my friends to play on the school badminton court or tennis court. I think it's very interesting. </P><br>
  
  <P>Secondly, I like running. Running is a beneficial sport. It can not only improve my body temperature, but also promote metabolism. </P><br>
  
  <P>Not only that, I also like reading, because reading English books can improve my English level and improve my knowledge. Sometimes I find reading very boring, but I don't feel tired when I think I have a harvest. </p><br><br>
   <h1> ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES </h1><br>
  <h5>ADVANTAGES: </h5><br>
<p>I am very responsible and always complete all my duties on time. Basically submit my results before the task deadline.</p><br>

<p>I am very organized, which is strongly reflected in the quality of my study and work. I will have a plan for my life.</p><br>

<p>I have good communication skills. I believe that communication skills are very important in study or work. Good communication can solve many troublesome things.</p><br>
  
  <h5>DISADVANTAGES: </h5><br>
 
  <p>I am not very patient. That’s obviously bad. But I am working on it every day, trying to control myself and be more tolerant to the others. It’s not easy, but I definitely made good progress in recent years.</p><br>

<p>Sometimes I struggle to concentrate in job. However, I practice every day and my concentration has improved over the years. I try to eliminate other thoughts and focus purely on my job.</p><br>

<p>I trust people too much. It is nice to live with such feelings, but it caused me many troubles in the past. However, as I am getting older, I can much better distinguish friends from foes. </p><br><br>
   <h1> WORK EXPERIENCE</h1><br>
  <P> In my spare time, I will also participate in some voluntary activities. </p><br>
<p>For example, in October 2020, I participated in the volunteer activities of the third world "Ningbo help. Help Ningbo" development conference;</p> <br>
<p>For example, I participated in the volunteer service of the second ecological games in Zhejiang Province in April 2021.</P><br>
